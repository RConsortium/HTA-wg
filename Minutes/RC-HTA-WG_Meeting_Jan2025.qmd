## Meeting Highlights

* A session proposal to ISPOR has been submitted (See agenda below)
* Anders Gorst-Rasmussen EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting 29th November 2024 (See agenda below)
* The WG has committed to starting a webinar series to foster debate around the advantages of using R in HTA production work (Proposal discussion starts at 14 minutes into the video)
* A general discussion about the webinar series begins at 16 minutes into the video.
* There was general agreement that the WG should present a vision of what a fully R-based HTA submission would look like. Showing how we could build an ecosystem where things all work together
* We must alleviate the fear of being the first to embrace R that companies have.
* We must map out where we are now and identify the gaps that need to be filled to get to the vision.
* Validation of statistical code is important
* Version control is important
* We must make the business case for R and open source
* The WG agreed on trying to produce the first webinar in April built around a panel discussion
* Proposed theme for webinar: *A Vision of R in Production Level HTA*
* The format for the first webinar will be a kick off speaker followed by a panel discussion with four participants
* The panel discussion could be driven by four or five questions determined before hand.





## Action Items
* Describe the current capabilities. e.g.. Indirect treatment analysis naturally sits in R
* Articulate a future vision based on R along with the pathway to achieving the vision
* Jordan volunteered to begin a one page document about the steps necessary
* Invite representatives from HTA regulatory bodies to the webinar series
* Articulate the theme of the first webinar and decide on the format
* We need to set a date in April and get going on the necessary logistics
* Assemble the panel
* Volunteers for the panel: Christian Haargaard Olsen, Robert Smith, Karolin Struck
* Please communicate off-line by sharing your ideas in the discussion on the github page
* Gregory to set up the discussion on the GitHub repository
* Gregory and Joseph to work with R Consortium on:
  * The webinar logistics
  * Setting a meeting to discuss the panel for the webinar
  




## Agenda

This agenda was prepared before the meeting.

-   Welcome Back! \~2 mins
-   Update: A Session Proposal submitted to ISPOR \~3 mins
-   Update: EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting (Brussels) in 2024 \~5 mins
-   Workstream 1: Proposed Activities \~40 min
-   Closing \~5 mins

## Update: A Session Proposal submitted to ISPOR

-   Submitted by Dominic Muston (Health Economics & Decision Sciences, MSD) as the moderator, on behalf of 3 speakers
-   Title: Flip (To) The Script: Rethinking Health Economic Modeling for HTAs
-   Issue (Provide a clear definition of the issue to be presented and debated): There are abundant cases of critical errors in decision-making and reporting resulting from organizations’ dependencies on spreadsheet workbooks for complex data-driven analytics. Spreadsheets easily become bloated and slow, and results often not reproducible. Nevertheless, spreadsheet modeling is highly prevalent in health economic modeling conducted for and evaluated by Pharma and HTA bodies, with accompanying risks to decision-making. Script-based languages such as R provide potential solutions, but have never had strong endorsement from HTAs, and may not yet fully address others’ needs. This panel will discuss: What issues or concerns have speakers observed in the health economic models developed or reviewed? How do we best mitigate risks in results or decision-making from spreadsheet-induced errors? Does the future lie in script-based modeling (using R or other languages)? What would it take for both HTAs and Pharma to ‘flip to script’?

## Update: EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting (Brussel) in 2024

EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting 29th November 2024

-   Anders represented European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI) in the *European Commission EU HTA Stakeholder Network*
    -   A construct within the EU HTA regulation
    -   Supporting the work of the Coordination Group (CG) and its' subgroups
    -   Currently meeting twice annually
-   Meeting 29th November 2024 in Brussels
    -   EFSPI presentation: *Open-source statistical code and its potential for EU HTA JCA*

### Relevance for R Consortium HTA WG?

-   In the EFSPI presentation, RC-HTAWG is framed as a hub to connect across stakeholders and perspectives
-   Call to action: dialogue with CG and national bodies to catalyze development and impact direction

### What is the workstream solving for?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### Objectives

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### Proposed activities

1.  Stakeholder identification
2.  Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
3.  Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### Proposed outcome(s)

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)
