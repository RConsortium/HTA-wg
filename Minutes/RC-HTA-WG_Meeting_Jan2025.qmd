## Update: A Session Proposal submitted to ISPOR

-   Submitted by Dominic Muston (Health Economics & Decision Sciences, MSD) as the moderator, on behalf of 3 speakers
-   Title: Flip (To) The Script: Rethinking Health Economic Modeling for HTAs
-   Issue (Provide a clear definition of the issue to be presented and debated): There are abundant cases of critical errors in decision-making and reporting resulting from organizations’ dependencies on spreadsheet workbooks for complex data-driven analytics. Spreadsheets easily become bloated and slow, and results often not reproducible. Nevertheless, spreadsheet modeling is highly prevalent in health economic modeling conducted for and evaluated by Pharma and HTA bodies, with accompanying risks to decision-making. Script-based languages such as R provide potential solutions, but have never had strong endorsement from HTAs, and may not yet fully address others’ needs. This panel will discuss: What issues or concerns have speakers observed in the health economic models developed or reviewed? How do we best mitigate risks in results or decision-making from spreadsheet-induced errors? Does the future lie in script-based modeling (using R or other languages)? What would it take for both HTAs and Pharma to ‘flip to script’?

## Update: EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting (Brussel) in 2024

EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting 29th November 2024

-   Anders represented European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI) in the *European Commission EU HTA Stakeholder Network*
    -   A construct within the EU HTA regulation
    -   Supporting the work of the Coordination Group (CG) and its' subgroups
    -   Currently meeting twice annually
-   Meeting 29th November 2024 in Brussels
    -   EFSPI presentation: *Open-source statistical code and its potential for EU HTA JCA*

### Relevance for R Consortium HTA WG?

-   In the EFSPI presentation, RC-HTAWG is framed as a hub to connect across stakeholders and perspectives
-   Call to action: dialogue with CG and national bodies to catalyze development and impact direction

### What is the workstream solving for?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### Objectives

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### Proposed activities

1.  Stakeholder identification
2.  Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
3.  Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### Proposed outcome(s)

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)
