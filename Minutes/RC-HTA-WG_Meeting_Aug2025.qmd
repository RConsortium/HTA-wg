## Welcome Back from Summer! ☀️🏖️

### Still in vacation mode? Perfect timing!

Today's theme **"Reflect and Restart"** is designed for our post-vacation energy:

- 🍹 **Reflect** - Look back at our journey (like flipping through vacation photos)
- 🔋 **Recharge** - Channel that fresh energy into new initiatives  
- 🚀 **Restart** - Launch into autumn with renewed focus

*Let's ease back into work mode together...*

---

## Agenda

1. **Reflection on Progress** - WS1 & WS2 achievements
2. **Emerging Opportunities** - New initiatives from community discussions
3. **WS2 Deep Dive** - Roadmap, milestones, and modular tasks
4. **Call to Action** - Join parallel workstreams

---

## Our Journey So Far

### October 2024 → August 2025

- **Community stabilized** at 20-40 active participants per meeting
- **Two workstreams** established and evolving
- **Active webinar series** presenting industry perspectives
- **Public visibility** via R Consortium's Channels and 2 conference in 2025

---

## Working Stream 1: Achievements

### ✅ What We've Accomplished

- **Launched webinar series**: [Identifying Needs, Streamlining Processes, and Building Bridges](https://r-consortium.org/webinars/r-for-health-technology-assessment-identifying-needs-streamlining-processes-and-building-bridges.html)
- **Attracted attention** at R for HTA workshop and PSI 2025
- **Identified key challenges** in HTA R adoption through stakeholder feedback

### 🎯 In Progress

- **Future webinar series** - Economic modeling focus planned for upcoming sessions

---

## Working Stream 2: Progress Update

### ✅ Initial Foundations

- **Defined assessment aspects** with input from OpenStatsWare and cross-industry initiatives
- **Created framework** for R package inventory across three dimensions:
  - Software Engineering (SWE) aspects
  - Scientific validity aspects  
  - Adoption readiness aspects

### ⚠️ Challenge Identified

- Vision/end-goal was clear but **roadmap not plotted** into milestones and tasks
- Need for **modular, parallel workstreams** to accelerate progress
- **Survey response** for HTA analytic R packages remains slow

---

## Emerging Opportunities

### 1. Common Data Model for HTA

**Vision**: Standardization beyond outputs

- Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs)
- **Aggregated data structures** for meta-analyses
- Dynamic visualizations via Shiny apps
- Reusable downstream solutions

### 2. WG Website Development

**Purpose**: Central hub for resources, documentation, and community engagement

---

## Priority Initiatives for Collective Action

### Breaking into Manageable Parallel Streams

1. **Webinar Series Continuation** - Industry case studies
2. **Common Data Model Development** - TFLs and aggregated data
3. **WS2 Package Inventory Implementation** - Assessment and curation
4. **Website & Communications** - Community hub development
5. **Pilot Projects** - Real-world validation with HTA bodies

*We need volunteers to lead and contribute to each stream!*

# Working Stream 2: Deep Dive {.section}

## Building a Trusted R Package Ecosystem for HTA

---

## WS2 Mission & Objectives

### As stated in GitHub Discussion #5:

**Mission**: Create a curated, validated inventory of R packages for HTA analytics

**Objectives**:
- Establish transparent assessment criteria
- Build searchable package repository
- Provide validation documentation
- Enable community contributions

### Why This Matters:
- **HTA-Body confidence** in R-based submissions
- **Reduced duplication** of validation efforts
- **Accelerated adoption** through shared resources
- **Quality assurance** through community review

---

## Assessment Framework: Three Dimensions

Based on cross-industry input (OpenStatsWare, R Validation Hub):

- **Reference implementations** comparison
- **Numerical stability** checks

### 👥 Manual Review Required  
- **Statistical methodology** correctness
- **Alignment with HTA guidelines** (NICE, IQWiG, HAS)
- **Clinical relevance** of outputs
- **Peer review** by domain experts (minimum 2 reviewers)

---

## Adoption Aspects: Production Readiness

### 🤖 Automated Assessment

- **Issue tracker** activity and response times
- **Update frequency** and maintenance status
- **Reverse dependencies** count

### 👥 Manual Review Required
- **Use cases** in actual HTA submissions
- **User community** feedback and support
- **Training materials** availability
- **Integration** with existing workflows

---
