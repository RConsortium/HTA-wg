## Agenda

1.  Welcome from co-chairs (Gregory and Anders)
2.  Vision for the working group
3.  Two initial proposed workstreams
4.  How we work together: managing engagement, format of the meetings, how to raise new ideas

## Vision for the working group
### Evolving policy landscape as a catalyst for a more unified approach to HTA analytics through R

## Two initial workstreams/projects

1.  Stakeholder and landscape mapping, and opportunity assessment (Anders & Dom)
2.  Mapping of packages related to HTA and evidence synthesis (Greg & Joseph)

### WHAT IS THE WORKSTREAM SOLVING FOR?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### OBJECTIVE

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### PROPOSED ACTIVITIES

-   Stakeholder identification
-   Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
-   Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### PROPOSED OUTCOME

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)

## Workstream: Mapping of packages related to HTA and evidence synthesis

**Objective:** To create an inventory of R packages related to HTA and evidence synthesis, facilitating their use and integration across different initiatives.

**Activities:**

-   Identification of R Packages:
    -   Conduct a thorough review of CRAN, GitHub, and other repositories to identify R packages relevant to HTA and evidence synthesis.
    -   Engage with the HTA community to gather insights and recommendations on useful packages.
-   Categorization and Documentation:
    -   Categorize the identified R packages based on their functionality (e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis, meta-analysis, decision modeling).
    -   Document detailed information for each package, including usage, strengths, and limitations.
-   Development of an overview:
    -   Create an accessible, user-friendly online directory to host the inventory (CRAN view?)

**Expected outcomes:** \* A publicly available inventory of HTA and evidence synthesis-related R packages. \* Presentation of the inventory at relevant conferences to raise awareness and promote its use.

**Supports focus area:** Develop and Document Best Practices:

**DM thoughts**

We need some workstreams to support Focus Areas 2 and 3, and workstream 2 seems a bit weak to me – it could be moved into workstream 1 easily.

For FA 2, could we document workstreams and best practices used or recommended by different stakeholders using R for clinical and economic evaluation? What do HTA bodies, industry, industry suppliers, academics propose? This may depend on whether the evaluation comes from the industry side – who may better understand the value of their innovation – or from the academic/HTA side – who may have a clear sense of the elements of value they consider relevant. (I don’t want to go down a rabbit hole of whole disease models since, with one exception, these are not used in evaluations.)

For FA 3, could we flesh out already what a proposed collaboration with a HTA body for a clinical assessment might look like? An economic assessment could be a good pilot too, in due course – but due to EU JCA, I think we might be aligned to start with clinical?

## How we work together

-   Introduction about yourself (very briefly)
-   Next meeeing at Nov 27 ??, Monthly meeting in 2025
-   Using Github issues or discussion in between
-   What are you thoughts on the two proposed projects, or any new ideas?
