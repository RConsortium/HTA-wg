### What is the workstream solving for?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### Objectives

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### Proposed activities

1.  Stakeholder identification
2.  Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
3.  Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### Proposed outcome(s)

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)

### Objectives

To develop a comprehensive inventory of R packages related to HTA analytics with useful information and application examples, facilitating their use and integration into daily practice

### Proposed Activities

-   Identify and categorize relevant HTA analytics R packages available in the open-source domain, with useful annotation
-   Establish and apply criteria to evaluate and monitor the production readiness of identified HTA R packages
-   Work with other initiatives (e.g. openstatsware, R for HTA consortium) to fill gaps of high-quality tools in key areas of HTA analytics
-   Fill in gaps of document and application examples for highly production-ready HTA R packages
-   Develop an online directory to host these work and facilitate ongoing engagement with the HTA R community

### Proposed Outcomes

A publicly accessible and user-friendly directory offering a categorized inventory of HTA analytic-related R packages with annotation, practical examples, assessment report of production readiness evaluated based on transparent criteria
