### What is the workstream solving for?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### Objectives

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### Proposed activities

1.  Stakeholder identification
2.  Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
3.  Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### Proposed outcome(s)

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)

## EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting 29th November 2024
:::::: columns
::: {.column width=40%"}
- Anders representing European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI) in the *European Commission EU HTA Stakeholder Network*
  - A construct within the EU HTA regulation
  - Supporting the work of the Coordination Group (CG) and its' subgroups
  - Currently meeting twice annually
- Meeting 29th November 2024 in Brussels
  - EFSPI presentation: *Open-source statistical code and its potential for EU HTA JCA*

### Relevance for R Consortium HTA WG?
- In the EFSPI presentation, RC-HTAWG is framed as a hub to connect across stakeholders and perspectives 
- Call to action: dialogue with CG and national bodies to catalyze development and impact direction

## Discussion
### A first look at drivers and obstacles of broader adoption of R for HTA

- To better target workstream 1 efforts before starting "for real", we want a high-level idea of different stakeholder perspectives 
- On the next slide, we have outlined some crude hypotheses - *we want you to challenge them*! 
- (we will take this to RC-HTAWG Github Discussions page afterwards, to continue offline)

## Hypotheses for discussion
### Anticipated value driver/obstacles by stakeholder to broader adoption of R for HTA analytics

- Do you agree with the below?
- What are other relevant hypotheses?
- Commonalities among drivers or obstacles?

::: {style="font-size: 100%;"}
| Stakeholder | Anticipated driver | Anticipated obstacle |
|-|-----|------|
| Pharma  | <span style="color:green;">Shape more efficient and robust analysis pipelines</span> | <span style="color:red;">Needs substantial investments with questionable return</span>
| CROs | <span style="color:green;">Improve efficiency and consistency between clients</span> | <span style="color:red;">Increased challenges with differentiation; gained efficiencies may benefit pharma more </span>|
| Academia | <span style="color:green;">Push novel methodology into 'production' more easily</span> | <span style="color:red;">More contraints  (new packages having to interact with standard packages) </span>|
HTA bodies | <span style="color:green;">Increase quality & consistency, reduce assessor burden</span> | <span style="color:red;">Creating unwarranted or difficult-to-control precedents</span> |

## Workstream 1: Update

-   opportunities: presentation about this HTA-R WG in brussel
-   stakeholder identification, what questions we need to ask to get to those learnings:
    -   “Many” = HTAs who accept and review submissions from manufacturers = All EU27 national HTAs, US ICER, Canada x2, UK NICE and SMC, Australia PBAC + at least a few from LATAM and Asia (can get advice here).
-   set up a in-meeting poll or discussion to collect feedback from the participants?
    -   strategically about how we can incentivize more HTA body participation, how can our WG help assessors optimize their processes + providing them with opportunities for professional development
    -   what do you need from an analytics platform or the reports/deliverables it can generate, and to what extent do current technologies (including R) address those?
    -   To what extent do you have preferences or are you agnostic about technology used?

## Workstream 2: Recap

### Mapping of HTA Analytics Related R Packages

### Objectives

To develop a comprehensive inventory of R packages related to HTA analytics with useful information and application examples, facilitating their use and integration into daily practice

### Proposed Activities

-   Identify and categorize relevant HTA analytics R packages available in the open-source domain, with useful annotation
-   Establish and apply criteria to evaluate and monitor the production readiness of identified HTA R packages
-   Work with other initiatives (e.g. openstatsware, R for HTA consortium) to fill gaps of high-quality tools in key areas of HTA analytics
-   Fill in gaps of document and application examples for highly production-ready HTA R packages
-   Develop an online directory to host these work and facilitate ongoing engagement with the HTA R community

### Proposed Outcomes

-   A publicly accessible and user-friendly directory offering a categorized inventory of HTA analytic-related R packages with annotation, practical examples, assessment report of production readiness evaluated based on transparent criteria

## Workstream 2: Update

### Share your ideas about this workstream in our Github discussion [here](https://github.com/RConsortium/HTA-wg/discussions/5)

For example:

-   Where to crawl HTA-related open-source R packages? ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html), [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search), Github Organizations nominated by this WG in discussion, etc)
-   What could be a good initial bag of labels to search for HTA related? These labels can be used as key words to search for relevant R packages from Open Source R Repository, and later annotation of the packages
-   What aspects of an R package are important to quantify risk and readiness for production usage? see some initial thoughts in https://github.com/RConsortium/HTA-wg/discussions/5

### Share Application Examples in Blog and Webinar Formats:

-   Beyond Mapping Packages: Simply listing R packages relevant to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and evaluating their production readiness is insufficient for enhancing R's adoption as an analytical solution.
-   Community Engagement: Actively engage the R community in developing and sharing materials that showcase state-of-the-art HTA analyses using R. This collaborative effort can help demonstrate the practical applicability and robustness of R in the HTA field.
-   Create and Share Content: Consider writing detailed blog posts or signing up for webinars hosted by the R Consortium to discuss how specific tasks or problems in the HTA space, such as meta-analysis or economic modeling, are addressed using R. Highlighting real-world applications can serve as valuable tutorials and enhance the documentation of the R packages involved.
