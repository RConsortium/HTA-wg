### What is the workstream solving for?

R is an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across stakeholders. There is a need for strengthening the shared understanding of challenges and solutions to accelerate the use of R in HTA production work

### Objectives

Map of stakeholders, landscape, and opportunities to guide future R-related initiatives and workstreams

### Proposed activities

1.  Stakeholder identification
2.  Landscape and opportunity assessment (focusing on R usage, overlaps, and perceived gaps)
3.  Roadmap (outlining key connections and potential collaborative projects)

### Proposed outcome(s)

Conference presentations and/or whitepaper(s)

## Workstream 2: Update

+ opportunities: presentation about this HTA-R WG in brussel
+ stakeholder identification, what questions we need to ask to get to those learnings:
  - “Many” = HTAs who accept and review submissions from manufacturers = All EU27 national HTAs, US ICER, Canada x2, UK NICE and SMC, Australia PBAC + at least a few from LATAM and Asia (can get advice here).
+ set up a in-meeting poll or discussion to collect feedback from the participants?
  - strategically about how we can incentivize more HTA body participation, how can our WG help assessors optimize their processes + providing them with opportunities for professional development
  - what do you need from an analytics platform or the reports/deliverables it can generate, and to what extent do current technologies (including R) address those? 
  - To what extent do you have preferences or are you agnostic about technology used?


## Workstream 2: Recap

### Mapping of HTA Analytics Related R Packages

### Objectives

To develop a comprehensive inventory of R packages related to HTA analytics with useful information and application examples, facilitating their use and integration into daily practice

### Proposed Activities

-   Identify and categorize relevant HTA analytics R packages available in the open-source domain, with useful annotation
-   Establish and apply criteria to evaluate and monitor the production readiness of identified HTA R packages
-   Work with other initiatives (e.g. openstatsware, R for HTA consortium) to fill gaps of high-quality tools in key areas of HTA analytics
-   Fill in gaps of document and application examples for highly production-ready HTA R packages
-   Develop an online directory to host these work and facilitate ongoing engagement with the HTA R community

## Workstream 2: Update

(Greg & Joe)


### Proposed Outcomes

A publicly accessible and user-friendly directory offering a categorized inventory of HTA analytic-related R packages with annotation, practical examples, assessment report of production readiness evaluated based on transparent criteria
