### Announcing the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Working Group

We are please to announce the new R Consortium HTA working group with a mission of promoting the use of R in all aspects of the health technology assessment process including both clinical assessment and economic evaluation. The motivation for launching this new working group now is the opportunity for expanding the use of R that are expected to develop from he upcoming implementation of the European Union Health Technology Assessment (HTA) legislation that will pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit EU-level HTA evidence dossiers as part of the EU HTA Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA) process. The comprehensive nature of the JCA and the tight timelines imposed by the legislation will raise the bar for the speed and complexity of HTA analytics that manufacturers must produce and that authorities must assess. Over time, we expect the methodological frameworks for HTA will become increasingly harmonized scross all twenty-seven countries of the European Union. The Methodological Guideline for Quantitative Evidence Synthesis: Direct and Indirect Comparisons, adopted by the [Member State Coordination Group on Health Technology Assessment (HTA CG)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/4ec8288e-6d15-49c5-a490-d8ad7748578f_en?filename=hta_methodological-guideline_direct-indirect-comparisons_en.pdf) in March 2024, will go into effect in January 2025. We believe that the challenges to implement the changes mandated by this document along with additional requirements for transparency, including providing statistical program code can best be met through the use of R language and the resources of the R ecosystem.

Initially, the working group will focus on the following objectives.

* Facilitate Collaborative HTA Statistical Work:
  * Promote the common goal of delivering HTA statistical work that meets regulatory requirements and efficiently utilizes R and the R ecosystem.
  * Encourage strong collaboration and knowledge sharing among stakeholders including government agencies.
* Establish and Document Best Practices:
  * Develop and document best practices for using R in HTA, providing clear guidelines and standards.
  * Promote transparency and reproducibility in HTA submissions and assessments.
* Develop Pilot Studies with HTA authorities
  * Initiate pilot studies to test and refine tools and methodologies, soliciting feedback from HTA authorities.
  * Use these pilot studies to demonstrate the value and applicability of R in real-world HTA scenarios.

If you think any of this is exciting and would like to become involved, please leave your name and email in issue number xxxx at the HTA GitHub repository.
