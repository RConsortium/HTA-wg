### Announcing the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Working Group

The R Consortium is pleased to announce a new Working Group (WG) focused on Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The HTA WG has a mission of promoting the use of R in all aspects of HTA analytics, including both clinical assessment and economic evaluation. It aims to build on the success of other R Consortium working groups in bringing together and promoting dialogue between the broadest range of stakeholders from the HTA ecosystem (industry, HTA bodies, academics and others) to identify needs and address challenges through practical tools and pilot exercises.

The primary motivation for launching this new working group now is the urgent need to improve the quality and efficiency of HTA analytics with the implementation of the European Union (EU) HTA Regulation. This legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit comprehensive evidence dossiers under a Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA) process, for review by EU assessors. The comprehensive nature of the JCA and the tight timelines imposed by the legislation will raise the bar for the speed and complexity of producing and evaluating HTA evidence. Critical to these clinical analytics will be the Methodological Guideline for Quantitative Evidence Synthesis: Direct and Indirect Comparisons, adopted by the [Member State Coordination Group on Health Technology Assessment (HTA CG)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/4ec8288e-6d15-49c5-a490-d8ad7748578f_en?filename=hta_methodological-guideline_direct-indirect-comparisons_en.pdf) in March 2024.

Economic analytics will also need to improve, reflecting the greater data transparency within the EU (and possibly beyond) afforded through the legislation, and the desire for more timely and evidence-based decisions on patient access to innovative technologies within national healthcare systems.

We believe that through its language and ecosystem, R will be well-placed to support stakeholders in addressing the challenges of EU JCA â€“ and HTA internationally. After all, HTA is hardly limited to the EU, and nor will this WG.

Initially, the WG will focus on the following objectives.

* Facilitate Collaborative HTA Analytics Work:
  *	Promote the common goal of delivering high quality clinical and economics analytics that meet the requirements of HTA bodies, and efficiently utilizes R and the R ecosystem.
  * Encourage strong collaboration and knowledge sharing among stakeholders including government agencies.
* Establish and Document Best Practices:
  * Develop and document best practices for using R in HTA, providing clear guidelines and standards.
  * Promote transparency and reproducibility in HTA submissions and assessments.
* Develop Pilot Studies with HTA authorities
  * Initiate pilot studies to test and refine tools and methodologies, soliciting feedback from HTA authorities.
  * Use these pilot studies to demonstrate the value and applicability of R in real-world HTA scenarios.
