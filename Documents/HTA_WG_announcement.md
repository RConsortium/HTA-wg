### Announcing the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Working Group

The R Consortium is pleased to announce a new Working Group (WG) focused on Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The HTA WG has a mission of promoting the use of R in all aspects of HTA analytics, including both clinical assessment and economic evaluation. It aims to build on the success of other R Consortium working groups in bringing together and promoting dialogue between the broadest range of stakeholders from the HTA ecosystem (industry, HTA bodies, academics and others) to identify needs and address challenges through practical tools and pilot exercises.

The primary motivation for launching this new working group now is the urgent need to improve the quality and efficiency of HTA analytics with the implementation of the European Union (EU) HTA Regulation. This legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit comprehensive evidence dossiers under a Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA) process, for review by EU assessors. The comprehensive nature of the JCA and the tight timelines imposed by the legislation will raise the bar for the speed and complexity of producing and evaluating HTA evidence. Critical to these clinical analytics will be the Methodological Guideline for Quantitative Evidence Synthesis: Direct and Indirect Comparisons, adopted by the [Member State Coordination Group on Health Technology Assessment (HTA CG)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/4ec8288e-6d15-49c5-a490-d8ad7748578f_en?filename=hta_methodological-guideline_direct-indirect-comparisons_en.pdf) in March 2024.

Economic analytics will also need to improve, reflecting the greater data transparency within the EU (and possibly beyond) afforded through the legislation, and the desire for more timely and evidence-based decisions on patient access to innovative technologies within national healthcare systems.

We believe that through its language and ecosystem, R will be well-placed to support stakeholders in addressing the challenges of EU JCA – and HTA internationally. After all, HTA is hardly limited to the EU, and nor will this WG.

Initially, the WG will focus on the following objectives.

* Facilitate Collaborative HTA Analytics Work:
  *	Promote the common goal of delivering high quality clinical and economics analytics that meet the requirements of HTA bodies, and efficiently utilizes R and the R ecosystem.
  * Encourage strong collaboration and knowledge sharing among stakeholders including government agencies.
* Establish and Document Best Practices:
  * Develop and document best practices for using R in HTA, providing clear guidelines and standards.
  * Promote transparency and reproducibility in HTA submissions and assessments.
* Develop Pilot Studies with HTA authorities
  * Initiate pilot studies to test and refine tools and methodologies, soliciting feedback from HTA authorities.
  * Use these pilot studies to demonstrate the value and applicability of R in real-world HTA scenarios.

We are pleased to announce the new R Consortium HTA working group, with a mission of promoting the use of R in all aspects of the health technology assessment process including both clinical assessment and economic evaluation. 

Health Technology Assessment (HTA) helps decision-makers determine which medical technologies and treatments are effective and worth paying for. It can help ensure that the right treatments reach the right patients at the right time by assessing clinical evidence and economic evaluations to inform policy making about reimbursement and market access.

Recent policy changes, like the EU HTA Regulation, require pharmaceutical companies to face stricter standards and shorter deadlines for submitting evidence. At the same time, HTA authorities must review an increasing number of complex analyses. Lastly, there is pressure on academia to provide easy-to-use HTA software and tools.

R is already an established tool in HTA work but the degree and type of adoption varies significantly across the different stakeholders. There is an urgent need to ‘connect the dots’ to truly leverage the power of R to accelerate the delivery of innovative treatments to patients.

The working group will have the following focus areas:

* Foster Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:
  * Understanding the needs of all stakeholders for HTA analytics, and where the use of R may best fit
  * Promote the common goal of delivering HTA analytics work that meets those needs and efficiently utilizes R
  * Become a central hub for connecting existing and new R initiatives in the HTA space, ensuring efficient and unified efforts.
* Develop and Document Best Practices:
  * Develop and disseminate best practices for using R in HTA analytics work for clinical and economic evaluation
  * Promote transparency and reproducibility in HTA analytics work
* Explore Pilot Studies with HTA authorities
  * Develop pilot studies to test and refine open source R-based tools and frameworks
* Pursue collaborative efforts with HTA authorities to validate these tools, demonstrating their value in real-world HTA scenarios.
